# Brands Tracker For Content Creators

The Brands Tracker Google extension is a powerful tool designed to assist content creators in managing potential brand partnerships seamlessly within their workflow, ensuring efficient collaboration and enhanced productivity.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for content creators. HTML formed the backbone of the extension, defining its structure, while CSS provided styling to enhance its visual appeal. JavaScript was pivotal, adding dynamic functionality such as tracking brand collaborations, managing partnerships, and facilitating seamless integration with Google's ecosystem. Through this blend of technologies, I transformed a vision into a practical tool, empowering content creators to streamline their brand collaborations efficiently.
